          <p>On February 19, 2014, TMZ posted video footage of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice dragging his then-fiancé, Janay Palmer, out of an elevator at the Revel Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The incident had taken place just a few days earlier, on February 15. On March 27, 2014, despite his plea of not guilty, Ray Rice was indicted on a charge of third-degree aggravated assault and was suspended for the first two games of the 2014 NFL season.</p>

          <p>Months later, on Monday, September 8, 2014, TMZ posted leaked security camera footage of what happened in the elevator, and it was graphic: Ray Rice can be seen punching Janay in a blow that immediately knocks her out. (Sidebar: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/22/inside-harvey-levins-tmz" target="_blank">The New Yorker recently did a deep dive into how TMZ obtains footage like this.</a>)</p>

          <p>It wasn’t just individuals who were partaking in the victim blaming. On the show “Fox &amp; Friends”, Fox News hosts seemed to make light of the abuse. Host Brian Kilmeade laughed while saying, “The message is, take the stairs.” His co-host Steve Doocy smiled as he added his two cents: “The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera.”

          <p>At the time of this news, Beverley Gooden (Bev for short) was a 31-year-old human-resources manager at a nonprofit in Charlotte, North Carolina. It had taken her a year to leave her own abuser, now her ex-husband, and she knew from personal experience that it’s not so easy to “just leave”.</p>
          <p>She was frustrated by the tone of what she was seeing in the news and reading online.</p>
          <h3 class="centered">So she took to Twitter, sharing her story using a hashtag she made up: #WhyIStayed.</h3>
          <p>She encouraged others to share their stories, and the response was swift.</p>

              <p>Bev Gooden, one of the criticisms of your initial posts were that it kind of kept the focus on the victims. And similarly with these, that the idea is still kind of having the victims explain instead of focusing on maybe why the perpetrators are acting the way they do.

              <p>Well, I think the development of the additional hashtags #WhenILeft and #WhyILeft was kind of the natural progression of the conversation. I was afraid at first that it would detract from the women who may not have left and kind of isolate them again. But I think with all the criticisms, the key for me is that #WhyIStayed isn't an endorsement of staying in an abusive relationship. You know, rather it's simply providing an answer to society's question. They asked and we answered. There are many reasons why someone would stay. And domestic violence isn't cut and dry. It's not easy, you know, to just say well, he hit you, you'll leave. It's very complex.”</p>

So you never know what a hashtag has inspired someone to do off-line. You know, the hope is that the hashtag will inspire action. There was a woman who - I think it was two weeks ago now - she tweeted to me that #WhyIStayed helped her get out and stay out. And if that's not direct action, I don't know what is.”</p>
